    "Suppose that we take a data set, divide it into equally-sized training and test sets, and then try out two different classification procedures.First we use logistic regression and get an error rate of 20% on the training data and 30% on the test data. Next we use 1-nearest neighbors (i.e. K = 1) and get an average error rate (averaged over both test and training data sets) of 18%. Based on these results, which method should we prefer to use for classification of new observations? Why?"

    "ANSWER\n",
    "- KNN works by choosing the k*th* nearest neighbor to each sample. If KNN = 1, it would lead to overfitting as each sample would be its own neighbor. In this case, it would be better to use the logistic model as it would better able to classify new observations"
